Sim U Duck App 
-------------

we have a game involving ducks. A duck can fly, quack, swim and it also has a display, may be that renders this duck in the game. 

`Duck` is a super class that already implemented `fly()`, `quack()`, `swim()`. The specific ducks - say `BlackDuck` inherits this `Duck` and implements `display()` method. 

Whenever we want to have new ducks in the game and they have different behaviors, we have a problem.

Suppose, we need to add `RubberDuck` that does not fly, squeaks instead of quack.
