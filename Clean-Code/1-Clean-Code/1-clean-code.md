# There will be code
Code will continue to exist in some or other form. It is the language to express requirements, it can be become more and more abstract, but will stay. Note that humans are not very successful in translating the customer requirements and code is just a way to express those requirements as precisely, accurately possible.

# Bad code
If we rush through features and do not care about the way we organize the code, we will be in deep trouble. Bad code can bring down companies.

# The total cost of owning a Mess
When we rush features, we create a mess because we do not spend or care about writing clean code. The messy code makes us slower and productivity falls. We cannot improve producitivty just by adding more people. Because they need to understand it and so on. If we add people and expect the situation to improve, that creates a pressure on everyone and we are prone to have more messy code. 

# The Grand Redesign in the sky
We might think a redesign will solve the issue. But the redesign needs to do everything that existing project does and need to do new features that are being added and the race between two prodcuts continues. By the end, it is likely that the new system is also a mess and we are in a situation thinking it's redesign. (Author explains the situation aptly, more vividly)

# Attitude
To make a one line change, we often need to change hundred different modules and ends up taking weeks of time. The reason good code becomes bad code is "us". Not the tight schedules, managers, customers or other stake holders. We need to care. If a patient tells a doctor to stop washing hands/cleaning tools/wearing mask, doctor should not bend to the will of the patient, even if patient is the boss. Same for us.

# The Primal Conundrum
We need to go fast. We make a mess if we just rush to go fast. And the mess we create slows us down. The only thing we can do is to clean code. It is the only we to go fast and keep going fast.

# The Art of Clean Code
Clean code like painting. we can spot a good painting but that does not mean we can paint a good picture. A programmer who writes clean code is an artist who can take blank screen and create an elegant system.

# What is Clean Code?
Famous people had their definitions, in their own words - [excerpt](excerpt.md) Overall, clean code is elegant, organized, efficient, maintainable and readable. It will clearly tell that it is written by someone who deeply cares.

Like all martial artists do not agree on same things, and form their own schools of thought. The things discussed in the book are the Author's ideas of how things should be. It is ok if we disagree but It would be a shame not to see and respect his view point :D

# We are Authors
When writing code we are the authors and future self and others are intended audience. So we are responsible for communicating well. Code is read more than written. We cannot write new code without reading the surrounding code, so making it read easier makes writing easier.

# The Boy Scout Rule
Code needs to be kept clean over time, so we must take an active role in preventing rotting or degrading.
*Leave the campground cleaner than you found it* - **The Boy Scouts of America**

Following that rule, always aim to check in cleaner code than you checked out. Clean up one variable name, one complex function, eliminate duplication and so on.. small clean ups do matter.

# Prequel and Principles
This book is a prequel to **Principles, Patterns and Practices**, that deals with Object oriented design. In this book we will find sporadic references to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), the Open Closed Principle (OCP) , and the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

# Conclusion
Books on art can't make you artist. You will get tools, techniques and thought processes. It's up to us. I think as we practice, read, review and implement more code keeping these things in mind. We will be natural and develop great code-sense.
